Create your own awesome FullHD timelapses!
This mod uses FFMPEG utility to record hiqh quality videos.

Place a building and start recording. Next ~50 minutes it will record 10 seconds of video. If you continue to record timelapse, it will choose your last constructed building in the last 50 minutes or it will choose a random city (if nothing was built).

Windows OS only
